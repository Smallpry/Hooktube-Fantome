# Notes

This is my first usestyle, with more to come. I made this to match the rice on my thinkpad. There will be a few more like this in the future.

# Usage
<ol>
<li> Download your favorite userstyle plugin (stylus, stylish, etc)

<li> Go to <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/158498/hooktube-fantome">this website</a> and click install style
<li> Enjoy!
<ol>
#Make sure to bring any issues with the style to my attention.
